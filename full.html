            <p>The third element of cryptography’s future covered at the IBM event is Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE), which allows data to remain encrypted during computation—regardless of the cloud or infrastructure used to process it. As a result, FHE could help drive greater adoption of hybrid cloud architectures, enabling data to move between clouds without compromising security.

                “If we have an application that has to do statistical analysis on a data set, the app needs to decrypt the data,” Eric Maass, Director, Strategy, Design and Emerging Technology at IBM Security Services, said during his FHE presentation. “But the act of decrypting the data makes that data vulnerable. With FHE, we can avoid exposing the data during computation.”
                
                FHE is based on a different mathematical algorithm than traditional encryption, designed so that computations can be performed directly on encrypted data. This emerging encryption model could allow third parties to process and analyze encrypted healthcare, financial or other data in the cloud and return accurate results to the data owner, without ever exposing the original data in plain text.</p>
