    <p>As a leader in quantum computing IBM has already deployed more than 30 quantum computing systems sine 2016 and released a hardware roadmap showing a clear pathway to viable quantum computers with more than 1,000 qubits and beyond. Despite quantum computing’s highly anticipated benefits, the technology’s superior capacity to factor large numbers has a lot of people concerned about the security of current approaches to cryptography as quantum computing matures.Acknowledging those concerns, IBM Research, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the broader cryptography community have for the past few years explored new approaches to encryption and data protection to keep sensitive data safe from quantum computers. One concern is that someone could steal encrypted data and hold onto it until quantum computing advances far enough to crack today’s encryption standards, NIST mathematician Dustin Moody said during the IBM event.</p>
